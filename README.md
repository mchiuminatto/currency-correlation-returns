# Currency Correlations on Returns


## Overview

For currencies pairs that share common currencies (base or quoted), the returns are correlated. 

For example, the returns of EUR/USD and USD/JPY and EUR/JPY are correlated because they share the USD currency.

The interesting thing to explore here is if changes can happen first in some regions so that we can predict the changes 
in other regions.


The goal of this project is to explore the correlation between the returns of different currency pairs, in particular,
for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and EUR/JPY.

But not correlation on the same period, but correlation on different period to see if we can predict the changes in one.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis.

With the data of the currency pairs, we will calculate the returns of each currency pair.

Then we will calculate the correlation between the returns of the currency pairs, plot the data and see if there is 
any pattern.


### Question
If a pattern is found, formulate the questions we want to answer about the observed pattern.


### Hypothesis.

We will transform the questions into hypothesis that we can test and the we will proceed with hypothesis testing.


### Predictions

If the hypothesis testing is successful, we will make predictions based on the observed pattern, for a different period.


### Conclusion

Finally, we will find a conclusion based on the results of the hypothesis testing and predictions.
